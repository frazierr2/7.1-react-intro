# 7.1

Week 7 and we started React JS. This is an intro into React framework. For the project we used Heroku and Parse servers along with React and created a input form where you input a picture and a caption. It then displays lower in the app. You also will be able to edit and remove the pictues and captions.  


### Tech Used

During the development of this project I used the following technology:


* [HTML5] - latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages
* [CSS3] - latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - fast and concise Javascript Library
* [Backbone.js] - light weight Javascript library to structure applications
* [React.js] - declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces
